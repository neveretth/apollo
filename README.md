# Apollo

In pursuit of stellar simulation.

## DISCLAIMER
_APOLLO is largely a testing ground and learning environment!
Things here are largely unpolished and all unfinished!_

## Documentation
Documentation for Apollo exists in the Documentation/ directory.

## Quickstart
The Apollo build system expects a file `Makefile.user` to exist in the root 
directory. This file can be empty, and does not _need_ to exist. This file
is used to specify non-default build options for `GCC, CFLAGS, etc`.
