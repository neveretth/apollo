# Code Format

The code format for Apollo is primarily dictated by the .clang-format file that
exists in the root directory. 

## Preferences
- Underscore separated (snake-case) variables/types/etc
  - foo_bar NOT fooBar/FooBar

- typedef is acceptable for datatypes (typedef float flt_t), NOT for structures!
